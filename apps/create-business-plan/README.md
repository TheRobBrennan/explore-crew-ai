This example was inspired by [Maya Akim](https://www.youtube.com/@maya-akim)'s video - [How I Made AI Assistants Do My Work For Me: CrewAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJvXT25LkwA) - and significantly enhanced to reflect my tastes in implementing a modular design that is validated with unit tests.

Please copy `.env.sample` to `.env` so you can supply a valid OpenAI API key and any other desired environment variables.
