# Welcome

This project will explore getting started developing with [Python](https://www.python.org) as quickly as possible using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Local development

If you are using Python for development, the `manage.sh` script provides several utility commands to streamline common tasks:

- `./manage.sh setup` - **Set up the environment and start the application:** This command prepares the development environment by creating a virtual environment in the `.venv` directory (if it doesn't exist). If a `requirements.txt` file is present in the specified app directory (default is `apps/hello_world`), the dependencies listed will be installed. After setting up the environment, the application script (default is `hello_world.py`) is executed.
- `./manage.sh start` - **Start the application:** This command ensures that the virtual environment is set up, activates it, and then runs the specified application script. After execution, the virtual environment is deactivated.
- `./manage.sh test` - **Run tests:** This command ensures that the virtual environment is set up and then runs the tests using pytest. If you want to test with coverage, use the `--coverage` flag.
- `./manage.sh test --coverage` - **Run tests with coverage:** This command runs all tests and generates a coverage report. The report is generated in the `htmlcov` directory, and the index page of the report is automatically opened in your default browser.
- `./manage.sh destroy` - **Clean up the environment:** This command removes the `.venv` virtual environment, effectively deleting all the installed packages and configurations. It's useful when you want to reset your development environment.

Note: You can customize the app directory and script by setting the `APP_DIR` and `APP_SCRIPT` environment variables, respectively. For instance:

```sh
APP_DIR="myappdir" APP_SCRIPT="myscript.py" ./manage.sh
```

This would use `myappdir` as the app directory and `myscript.py` as the application script.

### For JavaScript Developers

If you're more familiar with JavaScript development and have `npm` installed, we've made it easier for you to work with this Python project. There are several helper scripts defined in the `package.json` file which are wrappers around the above `manage.sh` commands:

- `npm run setup` - Sets up the environment and starts the application. Equivalent to `./manage.sh setup`.

- `npm run start` - Starts the application. Equivalent to `./manage.sh start`.

- `npm run test` - Runs all tests. Equivalent to `./manage.sh test`.

- `npm run test:coverage` - Runs tests and generates a coverage report. Equivalent to `./manage.sh test --coverage`.

- `npm run destroy` - Cleans up the environment by removing the virtual environment. Equivalent to `./manage.sh destroy`.

- `npm repo` - Opens the project repository in your default browser. This is a quick way to access the source code, documentation, and other related resources.

Utilizing these npm scripts, you can manage the Python application using commands you're familiar with from the JavaScript ecosystem.

### EXAMPLE: Hello, world!
What project starter would be complete without an obligatory "Hello, world!" example? ðŸ¤“

```sh
(.venv) hello-world % python3 hello_world.py 
Hello, world!
```

This project also includes having an ability to debug code using VS Code - and example unit tests to get you started:

## Python cheat sheet
If you're just getting started with Python, here are snippets of commands that you may find helpful to get you up and running in no time.

```sh
# Verify that you have Python installed on your machine
% python3 --version
Python 3.11.1

# Create a new virtual environment for the project
% python3 -m venv .venv

# Select your new environment by using the Python: Select Interpreter command in VS Code
#   - Enter the path: ./.venv/bin/python

# Activate your virtual environment
% source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) %

# PREFERRED: Install the packages from requirements.txt
(.venv) % pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Python packages in a virtual environment
# (.venv) % pip install <package_name>

# Install Python testing packages
# (.venv) % pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
# (.venv) % pip install pytest-cov

# When you are ready to generate a requirements.txt file
# (.venv) % pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Uninstall the package from your virtual environment
# (.venv) % pip uninstall simplejson

# Remove the dependency from requirements.txt if it exists
# (.venv) % pip uninstall -r requirements.txt

# To run unit tests:
# (.venv) % pytest

# To run unit tests and automatically view the HTML coverage report on macOS:
# (.venv) % pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html && open htmlcov/index.html

# To run a single unit test
# (.venv) % pytest test_something.py

# Deactivate your virtual environment
(.venv) % deactivate
% 

```
