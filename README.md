# Welcome

This project explores working with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) to assemble a crew of AI agents—powered by large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI ChatGPT 4—to work together and achieve a common goal.

**IMPORTANT: Using OpenAI will incur actual costs when running this code.**

For example, a single run of the `create-business-plan` example cost me **$0.79**.

For more details, please see the [OpenAI Developer Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).
